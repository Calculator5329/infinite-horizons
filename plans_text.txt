### OVERALL PLAN ###

Master Project Plan: 2D Sci-Fi Game with LLM-Generated Missions, Dynamic NPCs, Faction Wars, and a Living Economy

1. Overview
This is an open-ended, procedurally generated space RPG where the player:
Travels between planets, engaging in combat, diplomacy, and trade.
Undertakes LLM-generated missions that dynamically adapt to the game world.
Forges alliances, builds their own faction, and influences galactic politics.
Trades, smuggles, and manipulates the economy while gathering intelligence.
Designs and shapes planetary governments, pushing for policy changes.
Manages a fleet of ships and a crew, growing their influence.
Interacts with highly dynamic NPCs who evolve based on political, economic, and personal factors.

2. Core Gameplay Systems
A. Mission System
LLM dynamically generates missions by combining:
Structured objectives (predefined minigames and mechanics)
Procedural world-building (context, consequences, lore)
Branching choices (combat, diplomacy, stealth, trade)
Randomized or context-aware rewards
First Mission Example:
Smuggle oppressed citizens out of a faction-controlled system.
Engage in real-time ship combat to escape.
Deliver refugees to a free system for a reward.

B. NPC System & AI-Powered Interactions
1. Deeply Dynamic NPCs
NPCs evolve over time, shifting political allegiances, wealth, and roles.
Example: A former pirate becomes a politician, or a loyal friend betrays the player.
LLM generates backstories to explain changes.
2. NPC Data Storage (Each NPC Has a Folder)
FAISS Vector Database: Memory retrieval system.
Short Hardcoded Stats:
Mood, current situation, future plans, money, investments, political alignment, personality, history.
Deep NPC Backstory:
A large text file storing an extensive NPC history.
Allows LLM-driven long-term continuity in conversations.
Dynamic NPC Interactions:
NPCs may occasionally provide intel about faction wars, trade, politics.
Some NPCs can betray you based on past actions.

C. Factions & Political System
Faction Territories:
Galactic map shaded by faction ownership.
Dynamic faction expansion/contraction.
Governments & Political Influence:
Most planets have predefined government types.
Player can push for changes (diplomacy, funding political movements, sabotage).
LLM analyzes political structures and assigns stability metrics.
Faction Wars & Power Balancing:
If a war erupts, the player can lead the rebellion.
If too powerful, opposing factions unite to overthrow the player.
Real-time faction economy, military strength, and political shifts.
Political Subtypes:
Fascist → Leads to Militant state.
Conservative → Stable, but slow growth.
Stable → Always short-lived.
Progressive → High scientific progress, but low military.
Communist → Becomes Militant over time.
Rebel/Anarchist → Free but chaotic.

D. Economy & Trade System
Dynamic Market on Every Planet
Prices fluctuate based on wars, shortages, economic crashes.
Smuggling & Black Markets
Players can smuggle illegal goods, risking detection.
Inspections, bribery, and faction-policed space travel.
Stock Market System
Company stocks fluctuate based on trade, political events, faction wars.
Players can gather insider knowledge by talking to employees.
Ship & Tech Upgrades
Better ships are expensive and require investment.
Rare AI Cores (Nvidia chips, RAM, CPUs) used for ship AI enhancements.
Cloaking devices, hacking tools, rocket boosters for ship customization.

E. Combat System
1. Real-Time Combat (Space & Ground)
Ship Combat:
Inspired by Space Invaders, but with free movement in any direction.
Upgradeable weapons, shields, and AI-driven ship combat.
Ground Combat:
Blasters, drones, remote-controlled robots, destructible environments.
Combat AI for factions, allowing large-scale planetary skirmishes.
2. Turn-Based Combat (Later Implementation)
Strategic battle system for special missions.
Tactical positioning, squad-based engagements.

F. Galactic News System
Real-time news feed reflecting game events:
Wars, trade fluctuations, NPC promotions/demotions, betrayals.
Player can influence the news cycle via propaganda, bribery, or leaks.

G. Exploration & Worldbuilding
Galaxy Map
Faction territories evolve dynamically.
Procedurally Generated Planets
LLM generates history, government structure, and unique issues.
Scrapyard Raiding
Loot valuable upgrades using a tech minigame.
Hidden Knowledge System
LLM generates secrets, connections, stock tips, rare artifacts.

3. Technical Architecture
A. Backend & Database
SQLite (structured game data: factions, economy, missions).
FAISS Vector Database (NPC memory, player choices).
Procedural Event System (dynamic wars, economies, and politics).
B. LLM Integration
Mission Generation: Structured prompts mixing hardcoded mechanics.
NPCs & Conversations:
Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for continuity.
Political System:
LLM analyzes player-created governments and assigns stability metrics.

5. Final Thoughts
This game will combine deep player agency, dynamic NPC interactions, and emergent storytelling, driven by:

### COMMUNICATIONS SATELITE PLANS ### 

High-Level Plan for the comm_menu System
The Communication Menu (comm_menu) will serve as a central hub for interacting with planets, NPCs, missions, and galactic news. It will be accessed whenever the player interacts with a Comm Ship or planetary communication hub.

🔹 Core Features of comm_menu
1️⃣ Interaction Categories
When the player opens the Comm Menu, they will see a UI with the following options:

📡 Communications – Talk to NPCs, government officials, traders, or faction leaders.
🛠️ Missions – View and accept missions.
📖 Planetary Library – Learn about the planet’s history, politics, and market conditions.
📰 Galactic News – Read current events related to faction wars, economics, and politics.
🚀 Travel & Docking – Request landing clearance, trade routes, or fleet movements (later).
❌ Exit – Close the menu and return to gameplay.
🔹 How Each Section Works
1️⃣ Communications (NPC Interactions)
Displays NPCs available to talk based on faction reputation and story events.
Uses RAG-based LLM responses to keep NPC dialogue consistent.
NPCs will provide:
Faction Intel (Who’s at war? What’s changing?)
Trade Secrets (Market prices, smuggling routes)
Mission Leads (Hints about quests, hidden characters)
Gossip & Rumors (Minor details that might be useful)
Example UI:

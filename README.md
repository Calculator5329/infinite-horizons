# Infinite Horizons

A work in progress.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Calculator5329/infinite-horizons.git
   ```
   
2. **Change into the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd infinite-horizons
   ```

3. **Create a Python 3.10.11 Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   ```
   If your system uses `python` or `py` as the command for Python 3.10.11, adjust accordingly.
   If this doesn't work, ensure you have python 3.10.11 downloaded.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - On **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

6. **Install the Requirements**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing dependencies, you can run the main script or module as needed:
```bash
python main.py
```
(Replace `main.py` with the actual entry point if itâ€™s named differently.)
